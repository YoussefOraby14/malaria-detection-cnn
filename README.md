# Malaria Detection from Blood Cell Images

## Problem
Detect malaria-infected blood cells using deep learning techniques to support medical diagnosis.

## Dataset
Cell Images for Detecting Malaria (Kaggle)  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria

- Binary classification: Parasitized vs Uninfected
- Microscopic blood cell images
